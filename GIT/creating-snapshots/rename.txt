# to rename a file in git that has been added to tracking (staging area /index)
# there are two ways . we can rename the files ourselves by anymethod. or we can rename it by git.

# if we rename it ourselves , we have an untracked file and a deleted file .
# we can add both of them in the staging area. yes the deleted one also.
# so we get the renaming done.
#even if a file is deleted from the current directory , it is still there in the staging area .
# and needs to be either unstaged or to be added again to index to make sure it is unstage.
# adding it back to the index . ( doesnt actually put the file in the index, rather it ensures that the file is taken snapshot and deleted.)

//lets say file 1 renamed to file 2

git add file1.txt
git add file2.txt

# or we can use the git command.

git mv file1.txt file2.txt


#thus renaming of tracked files are made easy by the git command.

# for untracked files. even if we delete it , wont cause any issue / error
