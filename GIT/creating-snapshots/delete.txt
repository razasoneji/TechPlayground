# there are basically two meaning of delete when we talk about a repo that is being version controlled.
# 1. deleting files in git means either you can remove it from pwd and then stage changes(index it) and commit.
# 2. deleting also means you just want to remove the file from the staging area only( due to any reasons).

# to remove it from the project
delete the file
git add filename.txt     or    git add .    ( whichever is preferred)
git commit ( if required)

otherwise:::::
 
git rm filename  (does this all in one command).

# to remove it from the staging area only

git rm --cached filename

# When you commit after running this command,
# the file will be removed from the repository but will still be present in your local filesystem.
# ie file moved from tracking to untracking
