# create a gitignore file that can ignore the files, folder etc.
# create it in the main folder where the .git is present name it ".gitignore"

# add pattern (.log) , (.class) etc or add folder name , or add file name to be ignored.

# if the folder wanting to be ignored is already present in the staging area.
# then we can have the following command "git rm --catched filename"
