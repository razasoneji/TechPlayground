# moving to the detached head state also we are moving to the old commit

git checkout (id given by the git log --oneline)

# to restore to old state ( ie: head points to master and master points to last in the commit)

git checkout master

#moving to any commit and then doing the experiments can be done , but it is just advisable verify the process once
